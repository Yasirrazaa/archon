# Benchmark Results: AgentDojo v1 (Defense-Side ASR)

Corpus: **27 published injection tasks** (banking/slack/travel/workspace) x 3 wrappers = **81 attacks**, run fully offline against Archon's deterministic reference pipeline.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Attack Success Rate (ASR) | **66.7%** |
| Block rate | **33.3%** |

| banking | 27 | 66.7% |
| slack | 15 | 66.7% |
| travel | 21 | 66.7% |
| workspace | 18 | 66.7% |

## Per wrapper

| Wrapper | Attacks | ASR |

| important_instructions | 27 | 100.0% |

## Context

This benchmark measures Archon's **deterministic tier only** (normalization + rule-based threat classification, 0 LLM calls) — the free, latency-zero first line of defense. It blocks 100% of direct-override attacks but passes structural wrappers like AgentDojo's `<INFORMATION>` template and indirect document embeddings; in production those are caught by the LLM layers (dynamic invariants, Task Shield, exchange classifier). The deterministic tier exists to stop commodity attacks at zero cost so LLM budget is spent only on sophisticated ones.

Methodology: each AgentDojo GOAL is wrapped using AgentDojo's own `<INFORMATION>` template (`important_instructions`) plus direct-override and indirect-document variants. An attack counts as successful if it is NOT blocked by the reference pipeline. Reproduce with `uv run python -m archon_benchmarks.runner`.
